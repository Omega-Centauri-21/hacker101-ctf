## [Flag1](./flag1) -- Found

- The person with username "user" has a very easy password...

## [Flag2](./flag2) -- Found

- Try viewing your own post and then see if you can change the ID

## [Flag3](./flag3) -- Not Found

- You should definitely use "Inspect Element" on the form when creating a new post

## [Flag4](./flag4) -- Not Found

- 189 * 5

## [Flag5](./flag5) -- Not Found

- You can edit your own posts, what about someone else's?

## [Flag6](./flag6) -- Not Found

- The cookie allows you to stay signed in. Can you figure out how they work so you can sign in to user with ID 1?

## [Flag7](./flag7) -- Not Found

- Deleting a post seems to take an ID that is not a number. Can you figure out what it is?
