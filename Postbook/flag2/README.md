### Hint 
  - Try viewing your own post and then see if you  ```can change the ID```

<p>&nbsp;</p>

### Solution

Clicking on the posts; outputs that single Post to you. Seems like a dead end but heres the catch - 
look in to the url. ```http://<example>/82d79fefb8/index.php?page=view.php&id=2 ```

The id's control the post i.e. they resemble the post id. We have 3 posts on the Home page (unless you have posted more while trying the challenge yourself). By clicking on the post at the top it takes us to its page with an id 1.

Lets see what changing the id to 2 brings us -
