# __Flag 1__

As per the hint,  ```The person with username "user" has a very easy password```

## Approach 1
So lets try some weak passwords.
 ``` 
 username : user
 password : password
 ```
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 And we found the flag on our first try itself !!  
 
 ```
 ^FLAG^05213ee4ddefd7a2e3d4a1e78b5ee4696d66599d8b73f23d364987aa1aecfebe$FLAG$
 ```
 
 This was too easy. We got it straight away.  

## Approach 2

Another method to do this in a real-life scenario is to use ```Burpsuit```  to bruteforce the password for the user using a wordlist.
